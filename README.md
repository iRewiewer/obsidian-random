# Obsidian Random Plugin

As simple as it gets - adds a command for generating a ranodm number.
Either run the command from the command palette or bind a hotkey for it.

Features the following settings:
- Seed Value: add a seed to the randomness
- Low Value: lower limit of the random range
- High Value: upper limit of the random range

Planned features (aka maybe will add):
- support for generating 'n' numbers at once
- support for other types of random numbers, such as:
    - floats
    - bools
    - hexadecimals
- random.org support with your own API key
